# gs541-phylogeography

Uganda was one of the first African countries to contract coronavirus, according to the transmission map/animation. Uganda appears to have been seeded at multiple times by Europe, at least in part from France, starting in early February and continuing until early May. Ugandan coronavirus is then transmitted back to Europe early February according to the transmission animation, but the first case of coronavirus was recorded in Uganda in late March according to the phylogenetic tree. Presumably, this discrepancy is due to sampling error and fewer tests being available in African countries like Uganda compared to Western European ones like Spain or Italy. In late March, both Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo appear to  have been simultaneously seeded by the Asian epidemic.
